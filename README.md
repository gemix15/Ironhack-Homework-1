<h1><em>WELCOME TO LITTLE CODEWARRIORS BATTLE GAME</em></h1>

In this game you can start a battle between two characters. 
It's possible to choose between a Warrior, Wizard, Werewolf, Knight or Big boss. 

Each one of them has two different attacks, each character will make a random attack, the heavy attack spends 5 energy, the weak attack recharges 1 energy and in case of not having energy for any of the attacks it will recover two of energy.
